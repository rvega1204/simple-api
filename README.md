# Simple API - Node.js Application

This project is a **Simple API** built with **Node.js**, using the following popular libraries:

- **Express**: Fast and minimal web framework for Node.js.
- **Compression**: Middleware to gzip/deflate outgoing responses.
- **CORS**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Yup**: JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- **Helmet**: Security middleware to help secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

This API serves as the backend for the **Simple Client** ReactJS application, providing essential RESTful endpoints for data interaction.

You are free to modify or extend this API to meet your needs. Happy coding!

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Validation**: Utilizes `Yup` for validating incoming requests to ensure the integrity of data.
- **Security Headers**: Implements `Helmet` to secure HTTP headers and mitigate common security vulnerabilities.
- **Compression**: Response data is compressed using `Compression` to improve performance.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Configured with `CORS` for handling cross-origin requests.
